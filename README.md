InteractiveMap is an ambitious web application that combines the power of Leaflet.js and Chart.js to create an immersive and engaging experience for users to explore a fantasy world. The primary objective of this project was to develop a visually appealing and interactive map interface that encourages users to discover and learn about various locations within the fantasy setting. This singular map is a small section of a entire fantasy world I had made using wonderdraft for singular region maps and photoshop to combine the regions into one massive large world. I plan to make the entire application one large world map using the combination of different regions in the future. However as ambitous as this is, it is a large amount of data, assets, and resources, which requires cloud hosting of images using either Azure or AWS. The entire world map is a representation of the last several years of lore and worldbuilding for a fantasy franchise I am creating in my spare time.  

## Features

- Custom API that serves fantasy location data, allowing the application to dynamically render map elements and provide users with up-to-date information about each location.
- Detailed information about each location, including its description, species distribution, and class breakdown, accessible by clicking on specific map icons.
- Integration of Chart.js to visualize location data in a visually appealing and informative manner, with dynamically generated donut charts representing the species and class distribution for each location.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Leaflet.js
- Chart.js
- Webpack
- ES6 classes

## Development Process

Throughout the development process, significant effort was put into creating a professional-looking and user-friendly interface. The application's design incorporates fantasy-themed elements to enhance user engagement and immersion. The use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the implementation of ES6 classes, ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.

To optimize performance and ensure cross-platform compatibility, Webpack was utilized to create production builds of the project. The application was successfully deployed to a live server, making it accessible to users via a web URL. (At this time, the live server was removed as it was being hosted on my schools server)

## Challenges and Overcoming Them

The development of InteractiveMap presented various challenges, including the integration of Leaflet.js icons, dynamic data binding with Chart.js, and server-side deployment issues. However, through perseverance and problem-solving skills, these challenges were overcome, resulting in a functional and engaging interactive map experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/travisburns/interactiveMap.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd interactiveMap
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   Within the terminal, type `npm run`. This will initialize the `locations.json` file, which will activate the locations data.
   In the distribution folder (`dist`), right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
   ```




## Conclusion

InteractiveMap showcases the developer's proficiency in web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and Chart.js. The project demonstrates the ability to integrate custom APIs, handle data visualization, and create immersive user experiences. It serves as a testament to the developer's growth in technical skills, project management, and problem-solving abilities.
